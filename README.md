# plugin.video.saan.tv

This is video plugin for Saan.tv

On first run you will have list of all channels

##THIS WILL NOT WORK
* if you don't have username / password from http://saan.tv/

you need after installation enter username/password to get it working 

Any bug report/improvments are welcome


###Todo
- add check if username/pass is not entered and display dialog (for now error will be shown)
- optimize for faster loading
- make different layout for channels
- update graphics
